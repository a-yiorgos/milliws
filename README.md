# Heimdallr

Heimdallr is a tool that monitors the performance and the reliability of SDMX 2.1 RESTful web services. It does so by allowing users to create queries, which are then executed on a regular basis. In addition, Heimdallr offers aggregated statistics about the reliability and the performance of the web services being monitored.

Additional information about SDMX can be found on the [SDMX website](http://sdmx.org "Link to the SDMX website").

Additional information about the SDMX 2.1 API for the RESTful web services can be found on the [SDMX Github repository](https://github.com/sdmx-twg "Link to the Github repository of the SDMX Technical Standards Working Group").
