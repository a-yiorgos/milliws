# Meteor file system layout

This folder contains the Meteor collections used by Heimdallr. Because they are defined under the /lib directory, they will get loaded first by Meteor.

Meteor collections are special artefacts that are persisted by Meteor in a MongoDB database. Meteor also automagically synchronizes them with the client in real-time.

Collections are available in both client and server contexts.
